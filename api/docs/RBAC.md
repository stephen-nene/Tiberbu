Perfect ‚Äî you're using Django's `AbstractUser` and have a `role` field. So let's set you up with a **clean and scalable approach** that works for:

- ‚úÖ JWT-based authentication using SimpleJWT  
- ‚úÖ Role-based view protection (e.g. only `CLINICIAN` can access X, but everyone can access Y)  
- ‚úÖ Works with both **function-based views (FBVs)** and **class-based views (CBVs)**

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Your User Model Example (for reference)

Let‚Äôs assume your user model looks like this:

```python
# users/models.py
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models

class User(AbstractUser):
    class Roles(models.TextChoices):
        SYSTEM_ADMIN = 'system_admin', 'System Administrator'
        CLINICIAN = 'clinician', 'Licensed Clinician'
        PATIENT = 'patient', 'Patient'
        NURSE = 'nurse', 'Registered Nurse'
        SUPPORT_STAFF = 'support', 'Support Staff'

    role = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=Roles.choices, default=Roles.PATIENT)
```

---

### üõ°Ô∏è 2. Custom Role-Based Permission

You can create a flexible DRF permission class:

```python
# users/permissions.py
from rest_framework.permissions import BasePermission

class RolePermission(BasePermission):
    """
    Allows access only to users with specific roles.
    """

    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        allowed_roles = getattr(view, 'allowed_roles', [])
        return request.user.is_authenticated and request.user.role in allowed_roles
```

Use it like this in your **views** üëá

---

### üîç 3. Example in CBV (Class-Based View)

```python
# views.py
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from users.permissions import RolePermission

class ClinicianOnlyView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [RolePermission]
    allowed_roles = ['clinician']

    def get(self, request):
        return Response({"message": "Hello Clinician!"})
```

Or for multiple roles:

```python
class AdminAndSupportView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [RolePermission]
    allowed_roles = ['system_admin', 'support']
```

---

### üîÅ 4. Same for Function-Based Views (FBV)

If you're using DRF decorators:

```python
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view, permission_classes
from users.permissions import RolePermission

@api_view(['GET'])
@permission_classes([RolePermission])
def support_staff_view(request):
    request.allowed_roles = ['support']
    return Response({"message": "Hi Support Staff"})
```

But note: `request.allowed_roles` won't work by default with FBV. To make it work cleanly, use a custom decorator üëá

---

### üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 5. Cleaner FBV Role Decorator (Optional)

If you want to support FBVs cleanly with roles:

```python
# users/decorators.py
from functools import wraps
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import status

def allowed_roles(*roles):
    def decorator(view_func):
        @wraps(view_func)
        def _wrapped_view(request, *args, **kwargs):
            user = request.user
            if not user.is_authenticated or user.role not in roles:
                return Response({"detail": "Access denied."}, status=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN)
            return view_func(request, *args, **kwargs)
        return _wrapped_view
    return decorator
```

Use like:

```python
@api_view(['GET'])
@allowed_roles('clinician', 'nurse')
def nurse_or_clinician_view(request):
    return Response({"message": "Welcome Nurse or Clinician"})
```

---

### üß™ Bonus: Protect Django View (non-DRF) with Role Middleware?

Let me know if you want a **middleware** that restricts access based on role for pure Django views or templates.

---

Let me know if you want this tied into **token claims** too ‚Äî you could inject the `role` into the JWT so frontend knows who the user is. Want that?
